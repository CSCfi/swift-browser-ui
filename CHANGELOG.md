- Fix incorrect session fetch in backend when accessing objects owned by foreign projects
- Fix routing issues when accessing shared objects

## [v2.0.0]

### Changed

- **BREAKING** move to aiohttp_session with Redis as session store replacing own implementation

  - alignment in edit view of containers & objects
  - copy container view, sharing view and token view make it consistent with other views
  - key existence should be checked with `$te` https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/api/#vue-injected-methods
  - check public key exists already before adding to the table

- Drag and drop fixes (GH #497) and (GH #498)

  - stylize drag-and-drop overlay
  - use Vue store to keep public keys
  - move drag and drop files as well as files uploaded by button to store

- **BREAKING** swift-browser-ui doesn't work in Firefox's private mode, as it doesn't offer IndexedDB.
  - There is a warning message at login, and it is not possible to login in unsupported browsers.
- Improved performance by reducing number of requests after cache has been created.
  - While the cache is being created, there might be a degradation in performance for large projects.
  - Reduced number of requests for fetching object tags
- Search box in Container View now searches across all containers and objects in the project using IndexedDB.
  - Tag matches are ordered first, then containers, and then objects. In each of these 3 categories, results are ordered based on the order the matched word appears.
  - The search is different from the filtering in objects list. Query has to match beginning of tag or beginning of words extrated from the name.
  - Renamed the search box in Object list to say "Filter" instead of "Search"
  - Adding more words to the search narrows down the results. Only the first word searches the IDB, following words search in-memory.
  - A message is shown when trying to search a large project before cache is created.
  - Matching results are highlighted.
  - Results are limited to maximum 100 containers and 100 objects.

  - clean drag-and-drop after files were added as DataTransferItemList are kept

- **BREAKING** session handling without redis as session backend
- The possibility to share containers with write-only (file drop) permissions (GH #475)
- GH (GH #493) redesign upload UI
  - removed vue-material-design-icons

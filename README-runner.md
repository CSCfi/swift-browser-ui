### swift-upload-runner â€“ better browser file upload and download for swift-browser-ui

`swift-upload-runner` makes it possible to properly batch upload from browser
into object storage backends using Openstack Swift API. It will also make possible
proper container uploads without plaintext passwords or tokens, to prevent
token expiration.

Additionally, the runner contains functionality for downloading whole containers
as an archive without intermediary storage, as well as proxying downloads from
shared containers, i.e. containers where the project has access via an ACL entry.
